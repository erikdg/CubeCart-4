| 	4. Installing IonCube Loaders
+--------------------------------------------------------
If your server doesn't have the Zend Optimizer you may be 
prompted with a message such as:

"Site error: the file /path/to/file_enc_ion.php requires 
the ionCube PHP Loader ioncube_loader_xxx_x.x.so to be 
installed by the site administrator."

To do this follow this please follow these instructions.

a.	Go to http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php

b.	Download the suitable archive to your local machine.

c.	Upload the suitable loader file from the extracted 
	archive to the /ioncube folder. 

	e.g. /ioncube/ioncube_loader_xxx_x.x.so


Troubleshooting:
Please beware that if the loader you have downloaded fails
there may be an alternative one for different server architectures.

e.g. Linux (x86) vs Linux (x86-64)
